# APrioriNetflix

This is a repository to keep the files from the article developed to analyze data from a large movie dataset and use APriori algorithm to classify the movies and create a model with the best recommendations based on the movies that the user has watched - sort of like Netflix does after you finish watching a movie or series.
The code with the results can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/renatacavalheiro/moviedatabaseapriori
